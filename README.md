# Decentralized E-Voting Smart Contract

Welcome to DecentraEV Smart Contract i.e. crowd fund raiser system built on ethereum using solidity and deployed on replit. 

## Description

In the currently existing EVM system, we get to hear cases of vote manipulation, also in distant areas still the nuisance of booth capturing prevails making it difficult for a common man to cast vote for the candidate of his choice. Also after casting the vote, the current system doesn't assure whether the participant to whom the voter has voted, will get the vote or there will be hidden deliberately manipulative errors. To resolve such issues we present to you a Decentralized (and hence secure and immutable) E-Voting system (for an assured safe voting environment).
We know that blockchain is a humongous decentralised immutable ledger. One can harness the power of this technology to ensure the security of his vote along with his own safety as well as assurance that the one he has voted for will get the vote and hence no fear of manipulation due to lesser dependence over a centralised system of counting votes.

## How it works

The one who deploys contract will become the manager of the event. Only he can register requests (description, the wallet address of electing party who wants vote, list of participants who wish to cast votes, and total votes). The party with more than 50% votes will win the elections

## Examples

Let's say there are three parties :

1. BJP
2. Congress
3. AAP

and let's say there are 4 voters. 3 of them vote for the 1st party and 1 votes for the last one. So as per the condition set in the solidity program the 1st political party will celebrate their victory
